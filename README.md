## Description

In this challenge I was able to use the HTML structuring and CSS styling in order to create a website from scratch that will be used as a portfolio for myself in this class, and further as I job search.  Last week's challenge had a similar ideology of applying HTML and CSS, however the means of using the information were vastly different.  Instead of having starter code as a basis, challenge two perfectly mimicked to start with nothing and use that situation to website code.  I found it fun working through issues such as properly linking href's to their corresponding pages, which allowed for a better understanding of the concepts taught in class.  In this project I used HTML to build the contents of my portfolio page, and as well CSS to style these contents to my own personal design.

## Usage

This weeks challenge has a indefinite usage for myself.  By building a portfolio page as an homework assignment, I am also able to have it going further during my employment search.  Users, or more specifically employers, will be able to view my page and see: a description of myself via the about page, my works created in this course and beyond, finally a way to get in contact with me.  It was great toward something for this course that also has a professional application.
